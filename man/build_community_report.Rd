\arguments{
\item{output_df}{single row of results table from doaggregate - either results_overall or one row of bysite}

\item{analysis_title}{title to use in header of report}

\item{totalpop}{total population included in location(s) analyzed}

\item{locationstr}{description of the location(s) analyzed}

\item{include_ejindexes}{whether to build tables for summary indexes and supp. summary indexes}

\item{show_ratios_in_report}{logical, whether to add columns with ratios to US and State overall values, in main table of envt/demog. info.}

\item{extratable_show_ratios_in_report}{logical, whether to add columns with ratios to US and State overall values, in an extra info table}

\item{extratable_title}{Text of overall title ABOVE the extra info table}

\item{extratable_title_top_row}{Text INSIDE the extra info table, top left cell}

\item{extratable_list_of_sections}{This defines what extra indicators are shown.
It is a named list of vectors,
where each name is text phrase that is title of a section of the table,
and each vector is the vector of colnames of output_df that are indicators
to show in that section, in extra table of demog. subgroups, etc.}

\item{extratable_hide_missing_rows_for}{only for the indicators named in this vector,
leave out rows in table where raw value is NA,
as with many of names_d_language, in extra table of demog. subgroups, etc.'}

\item{in_shiny}{whether the function is being called in or outside of shiny - affects location of header}

\item{filename}{path to file to save HTML content to; if null, returns as string (used in Shiny app)}

\item{report_title}{generic name of this type of report, to be shown at top, like "EJAM Multisite Report"}

\item{logo_path}{optional relative path to a logo for the upper right of the overall header.
Ignored if logo_html is specified and not NULL, but otherwise uses default or param set in run_app()}

\item{logo_html}{optional HTML for img of logo for the upper right of the overall header.
If specified, it overrides logo_path. If omitted, gets created based on logo_path.}

\description{
Creates a short summary report with tables, map, and plot of indicators
}
\details{
This is used by the shiny app server. For use in RStudio,
see \code{\link[=ejam2report]{ejam2report()}} (which relies on this).

This function gets called by
app_server but also by \code{\link[=ejam2report]{ejam2report()}},
and also is used by the community_report_template.Rmd used to generate a report

It uses functions in community_report_helper_funs.R, etc.
