## THIS IS SOME NOTES ON WHAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE A VERY VERY BASIC REPORT-BUILDER THAT 
## LETS A USER SPECIFY WHICH SETS OF INDICATORS TO SHOW IN THE REPORT
## AND WHAT TO NAME THAT SUBSECTION


# notes on how to select groups of indicators but with a nice name for each group and name(s) defining members of each group, etc.
# example below shows you can have choices show up in groups,

# *** but still need a way to let the user rename each group ***

# AND still need a way to let the user specify the members of each group or pick some not all etc.

# and then server can evaluate the input as R code for a named list 
# as is needed for the extratable_list_of_sections param of build_community_report()
# but it would be a reactive value not an input if done like this

# SECOND EXAMPLE


# doing this way is not using the list actually, each list is 1 element long, quoted R code:

# in global_defaults_*.R :

default_extratable_list_of_sections <- list(
  
  `Breakdown by Race/Ethnicity` = "names_d_subgroups",
  `Language Spoken at Home` = "names_d_language",
  `Language in Limited English Speaking Households` = "names_d_languageli",
  `Breakdown by Sex` = "c('pctmale','pctfemale')",
  `Health` = "names_health",
  `Age` = "c('pctunder5', 'pctunder18', 'pctover64')",
  `Community` = "names_community[!(names_community %in% c( 'pctmale', 'pctfemale', 'pctownedunits_dupe'))]",
  `Poverty` = "names_d_extra" #,  # pctpoor
  # `Site counts and distance` = "names_e_other"
)
