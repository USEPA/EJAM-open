</h2>
<p>This document is about analysts or coders using the EJAM R package in
RStudio. After you <a href="../articles/1_installing.html">install the
EJAM R package</a>, this document explains how you can run an EJAM
analysis and view results right away using R.</p>
<p>This document is not about <a href="../articles/0_webapp.html">using
EJAM as a web application</a>, but you can launch a local web app after
installing the EJAM R package.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="load-ejam">Load EJAM<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#load-ejam"></a>
</h3>
<p>To start using EJAM in RStudio/R, you first attach/load the R package
using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library()</a></code> or <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">require()</a></code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<h3 id="analyze-places-with-ejamit">Analyze Places with <code>ejamit()</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#analyze-places-with-ejamit"></a>
</h3>
<p>To quickly try EJAM in RStudio:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># EJAM analysis of 100 places, for everyone within 3 miles</span></span>

<span><span class="va">out2</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/ejamit.html">ejamit</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">pts</span>, radius <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>To quickly try EJAM with an example input file (spreadsheet with
latitude and longitude of each point)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">myfile</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/system.file.html" class="external-link">system.file</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"testdata/latlon/testpoints_10.xlsx"</span>, package <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"EJAM"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="va">out</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/ejamit.html">ejamit</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">myfile</span>, radius <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">3</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you already have your own spreadsheet of point locations to
analyze, then in RStudio you can just use the <code><a href="../reference/ejamit.html">ejamit()</a></code>
function without specifying the locations or radius â€“ EJAM will prompt
you to select the file and a radius.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">out</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/ejamit.html">ejamit</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note: The file should be an Excel file or .csv file and the first
sheet (tab) needs to be just a table of one header row (with at least
two columns named lat and lon), and one row per site (point). No extra
rows, no merged cells, etc.</p>
<p>If you need examples of spreadsheets (and other input files you can
try), you can find the ones installed with the EJAM package in your
local folder, like this in the RStudio console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co">## See where the folder is and see what files are there:</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/testdata.html">testdata</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="co"># or see just the latlon files:</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/testdata.html">testdata</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"latlon"</span>, quiet<span class="op">=</span><span class="cn">T</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># dir(system.file("testdata/latlon", package = "EJAM"))</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="pick-a-radius">Pick a Radius<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pick-a-radius"></a>
</h3>
<p>You can specify the radius in miles. EJAM will analyze all residents
within that many miles of each point (site).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">radius</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">3</span> <span class="co"># radius (in miles).  5 km = 3.106856 miles, 10 km = 6.2 miles</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Converting between miles and kilometers â€“ If you know you want to
analyze for 5 kilometers, for example, you can turn it into miles.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fl">5000</span> <span class="op">/</span> <span class="va">meters_per_mile</span></span>
